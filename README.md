# Javascript lesson

## Welcome!

In the CAD-3MTT class lesson of 2nd March 2024, we added some javascript codes to an HTML form created in the previous class. See the repository for the previous lesson [here](https://github.com/aademola1979/CAD-3MTT-class-lesson-form-javascript). It's awesome, isn't it? However, the result of the previous lesson is that the output is displayed as an alert. The data disappears after refreshing the browser; the data does not persist. The lesson was purely a frontend lesson; hence, it ended at collecting and displaying the output through alert. I improved the previous project  to be able to persist the collected data, at least temporarily, by saving it into the localstorage on the browser?

- **Who is this for:** A javascript beginner
- **What you will learn:** You will learn to collect data through HTML form, store the data in the browser localstorage, retrieve the data back and send it back to HTML elements for display.
- **What you'll build**: a web app that can:
  1. receive inputs from users,
  2. validate the inputs,
  3. store the inputs in the localStorage of the user's browser,
  4. retrieve the inputs from the localStorage, and
  5. send the input to the HTML page for display.

Therefore, after the user fills the form, submits and refreshes their browser, the user can view inputs displayed as a card.
See the demo [here](https://aademola1979.github.io/CAD-3MTT-improved-class-lesson-form-javascript/).

- **Prerequisites:** The code has detailed comments, that will guide beginners through. However, a basic knowledge of HTML and javascript will further aid comprehension.

Parts of the javascript codes belong to my instructor at CAD.
